# Course: Fundamentals of Software Testing - Homework 🐛 Submissions

Welcome to my Bug Report Essentials! 👋

Here, you'll find my homework submissions for the first lecture, "What is a Bug Report?" This includes bug reports carefully crafted following an in-depth study of the materials. The focus areas encompass questions about bug report design and its attributes, effective tools for capturing screenshots, and strategies for precisely defining the core elements of a bug.

Each bug report is a product of my study, documenting the learning process using the Mantis bug tracking system. The source video for testing is available at the following [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/26bpxtzv2iczvoe2y1f5d/Slide-73-Video-with-bugs-for-homework.mp4?rlkey=dskhn0tj4g44avvzhuk2a4tuo&dl=0).
